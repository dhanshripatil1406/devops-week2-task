🎯 Introduction
Netflix is one of the best-known adopters of DevOps practices, using advanced automation, cloud-native infrastructure, and microservices to scale globally and release features rapidly.

✅ 1. CI/CD Pipelines
Netflix uses Jenkins for Continuous Integration.

Spinnaker (developed by Netflix) is their Continuous Delivery platform.

Every code change is automatically:

Built

Tested

Packaged

Deployed to production (if safe)

🔄 Goal: Achieve multiple deployments per day with minimal downtime.

🛠 Tools:
Jenkins, Spinnaker, Git, Canary deployments, Blue/Green deployment, Monitoring tools

☁️ 2. Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
Netflix migrated all infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

They use:

Auto-scaling: Automatically adjusts compute capacity.

Load balancing: Distributes traffic across servers.

Multi-region deployment: Ensures global availability and disaster recovery.

🧩 Netflix doesn't manage physical servers — everything is virtualized and scalable in the cloud.

🛠 Tools:
AWS EC2, S3, RDS, CloudFront, Auto Scaling Groups


🧱 3. Microservices Architecture
Netflix's architecture includes over 1000 microservices.

Each team owns and deploys its own service independently.

This allows rapid development and scaling.

💡 Example: One service handles user recommendations, another handles billing — all communicate via APIs.

🛠 Tools:
Spring Boot, REST APIs, Docker, Zuul (API Gateway), Eureka (Service Registry)


⚙️ 4. Automation & Monitoring
Netflix uses automation for:

Testing

Deployment

Monitoring

Failure detection & recovery

They introduced Chaos Engineering to test how systems behave under failure.

🔥 Tool: Chaos Monkey — randomly shuts down services in production to ensure resilience.

🛠 Tools:
Chaos Monkey, Simian Army, Atlas (Monitoring), Hystrix (Fault Tolerance)
